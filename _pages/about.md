Hi, Iâ€™m **Moyan Liu**, a researcher interested in control theory, complex systems, and climate resilience.

I use dynamical models like Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-84, ensemble forecasting, and chaos theory to explore new pathways for climate adaptation and extreme weather mitigation. Currently pursuing my MA at NYU.
